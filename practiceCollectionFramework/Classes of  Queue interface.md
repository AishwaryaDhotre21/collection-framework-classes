In Java, the Queue interface represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Queues typically follow a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, where elements are inserted at the end (rear) of the queue and removed from the front. Here are some of the main classes that implement the Queue interface along with their features:

### LinkedList:

*Features:*
- Implements the Queue interface.
- Doubly-linked list implementation.
- Provides operations for adding elements to the end of the queue (offer) and removing elements from the beginning of the queue (poll, peek).
- Supports both FIFO and LIFO (stack) operations.

### PriorityQueue:

*Features:*
- Implements the Queue interface.
- Priority queue based on a priority heap.
- Elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or by a specified comparator.
- Provides constant-time performance for insertion (offer) and logarithmic time for removal (poll, peek).
- Not thread-safe.

### ArrayDeque:

*Features:*
- Implements the Queue interface.
- Resizable-array implementation.
- Provides high-performance operations for both adding and removing elements from both ends of the deque.
- Supports operations such as offer, poll, peek, addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast, etc.
- Not thread-safe.

### ConcurrentLinkedQueue:

*Features:*
- Implements the Queue interface.
- Lock-free, concurrent, and scalable queue.
- Provides high-performance operations for both add and remove, especially in a concurrent environment.
- Guarantees weakly consistent iteration.
